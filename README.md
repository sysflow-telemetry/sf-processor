# What is SysFlow?

The SysFlow Telemetry Pipeline is a framework for monitoring cloud workloads and for creating performance and security analytics. The goal of this project is to build all the plumbing required for system telemetry so that users can focus on writing and sharing analytics on a scalable, common open-source platform. The backbone of the telemetry pipeline is a new data format called SysFlow, which lifts raw system event information into an abstraction that describes process behaviors, and their relationships with containers, files, and network. This object-relational format is highly compact, yet it provides broad visibility into container clouds. We have also built several APIs that allow users to process SysFlow with their favorite toolkits. Learn more about SysFlow in the [SysFlow documentation](https://sysflow.readthedocs.io).

The SysFlow framework consists of the following sub-projects:

- [sf-apis](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sf-apis) provides the SysFlow schema and programatic APIs in go, python, and C++.
- [sf-collector](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sf-collector) monitors and collects system call and event information from hosts and exports them in the SysFlow format using Apache Avro object serialization.
- [sf-processor](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sf-processor) provides a performance optimized policy engine for processing, enriching, filtering SysFlow events, generating alerts, and exporting the processed data to various targets.
- [sf-exporter](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sf-exporter) exports SysFlow traces to S3-compliant storage systems for archival purposes.
- [sf-deployments](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sf-deployments) contains deployment packages for SysFlow, including Docker, Helm, and OpenShift.
- [sysflow](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sysflow) is the documentation repository and issue tracker for the SysFlow framework.

# About this image

The SysFlow processor is a lighweight edge analytics pipeline that can process and enrich SysFlow data. The processor is written in golang, and allows users to build and configure various pipelines using a set of built-in and custom plugins and drivers. Pipeline plugins are producer-consumer objects that follow an interface and pass data to one another through pre-defined channels in a multi-threaded environment. By contrast, a driver represents a data source, which pushes data to the plugins. The processor currently supports two builtin drivers, including one that reads sysflow from a file, and another that reads streaming sysflow over a domain socket. Plugins and drivers are configured using a JSON file.

Please check [Sysflow Processor](https://sysflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/processor.html) for documentation on deployment and configuration options.

# How to use this image

### Starting the processor

The easiest way to run the SysFlow Processor is by using [docker-compose](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sf-deployments/tree/master/docker). The provided `docker-compose.processor.yml` file deploys the SysFlow processor and collector. The rsyslog endpoint should be configured in `./config/.env.processor`. Collector settings can be changed in `./config/.env.collector`. Additional settings can be configured directly in the compose file.

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.processor.yml up
```

Instructions for `docker-compose`, `helm`, and `oc operator` deployments are available [here](https://sysflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deploy.html). Alternatively, you can install the SysFlow Processor using its binary installers available in the release pages.

<!-- ### Configuration

Create a JSON file specifying the edge processing pipeline plugins and configuration settings.
See [template](https://github.com/sysflow-telemetry/sf-processor/blob/master/driver/pipeline.template.json) for available options. The config settings can also be overridden by setting environment variables following the convension \<PLUGINNAME\>\_\<CONFIGKEY\>. For example, you can override _export_ in the exporter plugin by specifying ```-E EXPORTER_TYPE=file``` when running the container. -->
